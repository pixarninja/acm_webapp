# NMT ACM Webapp Demonstration

## Abstract

This repo contains source files for the web application demonstration given at the ACM chapter of NMT. Topics I plan to cover during the demonstration are listed below:
- MVC Architecture
- JSP/HTML
- Java Servlets
- Java Beans
- SQL Databases
- PhpMyAdmin
- Basic Password Encription

## Backend Setup Resources

Since the demonstration time is only an hour, I won't be able to cover how to create the backend of the application. Below are links to resource material on the setup of the backend portion of the web application. I've also taken screen shots and explained the steps I used to create the backend.
